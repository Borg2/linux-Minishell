# unix-Minishell
This project implements a simple shell in C and C++.

# Description
The project consists of several files:

command.cc: Contains the implementation of command execution logic.
command.h: Header file defining data structures and functions used in command handling.
shell.l: Lexical analyzer for the shell.
shell.y: Parser for the shell.
Makefile: Makefile to build the project.
# File Descriptions
command.cc: Contains the implementation of command execution logic. It defines classes and functions to handle commands, arguments, input/output redirection, and background execution.
command.h: Header file defining data structures and functions used in command handling. It defines structs for simple commands and the main command, as well as function prototypes.
shell.l: Lexical analyzer for the shell. It tokenizes input strings into lexical tokens, such as words, redirection symbols, pipes, and background execution indicators.
shell.y: Parser for the shell. It parses the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and constructs command structures for execution. It understands basic shell grammar including command arguments, input/output redirection, pipes, and background execution.
Makefile: Makefile to build the project. It contains rules to compile the lexical analyzer, parser, and command execution logic into an executable shell.
# Build Instructions
To build the project, run:
make
This will compile the source files and generate an executable named 'shell'.

# Usage
To use the shell, simply run the generated executable: ./shell
now you can write commands into the shell prompt and excute them.
